# EU4-Mod-Maker

This is going to be a Mod Editor for Europa Universalis 4.

The first goal is to be able to make random countries in the game (making ideagroups,ideas, government reforms and types, religion, etc.)
, after that i am going to dive in map creating and else.

I want to make a program, where you can learn scripting as well, so i am planning to create a GUI, where you can switch between
code view and "making" view so you can see every code change, while you are editing the mod.
